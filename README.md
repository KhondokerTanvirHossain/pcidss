# Payment Service Provider - PCI DSS Compliance

## Introduction

This document outlines the PCI DSS compliance measures implemented by our Payment Service Provider and the design of our Payment Gateway Service Application.

## PCI DSS Compliance

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment.

### Goals

PCI DSS compliance is built around six goals. Here we outline how we meet each of these:

1. **Build and Maintain a Secure Network and Systems**

    - Requirement 1: Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data

    - Requirement 2: Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters

2. **Protect Cardholder Data**

    - Requirement 3: Protect stored cardholder data

    - Requirement 4: Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks

3. **Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program**

    - Requirement 5: Protect all systems against malware and regularly update anti-virus software or programs

    - Requirement 6: Develop and maintain secure systems and applications

4. **Implement Strong Access Control Measures**

    - Requirement 7: Restrict access to cardholder data by business need to know

    - Requirement 8: Identify and authenticate access to system components

    - Requirement 9: Restrict physical access to cardholder data

5. **Regularly Monitor and Test Networks**

    - Requirement 10: Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data

    - Requirement 11: Regularly test security systems and processes

6. **Maintain an Information Security Policy**

   - Requirement 12: Maintain a policy that addresses information security for all personnel

## Payment Gateway Service Application Design

Here we outline the key features and measures to meet the compliance:

1. **Secure Transaction Processing**

    - Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data such as credit card numbers and CVV codes during transmission. This can be done using SSL/TLS encryption.

    - Secure Sockets Layer (SSL): Implement SSL for all connections that involve sensitive data. This ensures that data transmitted between the server and the client is encrypted and secure.

    - Payment Gateway: Use a secure and trusted payment gateway. The payment gateway should be PCI DSS compliant.

    - Tokenization: Instead of storing sensitive data, use tokenization. This involves replacing sensitive data with unique identification symbols that retain all the essential information about the data without compromising its security.

    - Authentication: Implement strong authentication measures such as two-factor authentication (2FA) to verify the identity of users.

    - Fraud Detection: Implement fraud detection mechanisms to identify and prevent suspicious activities.

2. **Data Encryption**

    - Encryption Algorithms: Use strong encryption algorithms such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for encrypting data. AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm that is widely used and trusted.

    - Key Management: Implement secure key management practices. Encryption keys should be stored securely and rotated regularly. Access to keys should be strictly controlled.

    - End-to-End Encryption: Implement end-to-end encryption for data in transit. This ensures that data is encrypted from the point it leaves the sender until it reaches the recipient.

    - At Rest Encryption: Encrypt data at rest. This means that data stored in databases, files, or other storage methods is encrypted.

    - Hashing: Use hashing for storing sensitive data like passwords. Hashing is a one-way function that scrambles data. When combined with a salt (random data), it's very secure.

3. **Access Control**

    - Authentication: Implement strong authentication mechanisms. This could be through passwords, two-factor authentication, biometric verification, etc.

    - Authorization: Implement role-based access control (RBAC). This means that access to resources is based on the role of the user, and not the individual user themselves.

    - Access Control Lists (ACLs): Use ACLs to define who can access what resources. ACLs can be used to grant or deny permissions to specific users or groups of users.

    - Least Privilege: Follow the principle of least privilege. This means that users should be given the minimum levels of access – or permissions – that they need to complete their job functions.

    - Regular Audits: Conduct regular audits of access controls to ensure they are still appropriate and that there are no unnecessary permissions.

4. **Regular Audits and Monitoring**

    - Audit Logs: Maintain detailed audit logs of all system activity. This includes user logins, file accesses, system changes, and other activities.

    - Automated Monitoring Tools: Use automated monitoring tools to continuously monitor your systems for any unusual or suspicious activity.

    - Regular Audit Reviews: Regularly review audit logs to identify any potential security incidents or policy violations.

    - Alerts: Set up alerts for specific events or activities that could indicate a security issue.

    - Third-Party Audits: Consider having third-party security audits conducted on a regular basis. These audits can provide an unbiased review of your security posture.

    - Compliance Reports: Regularly generate and review compliance reports to ensure that you are meeting all necessary regulatory requirements.

5. **Vulnerability Management**

    - Vulnerability Scanning: Regularly scan your systems for vulnerabilities. This can be done using automated vulnerability scanning tools.

    - Patch Management: Regularly update and patch your systems to fix known vulnerabilities.

    - Risk Assessment: Conduct risk assessments to identify the most critical vulnerabilities that need to be addressed first.

    - Remediation: Remediate identified vulnerabilities in a timely manner. This could involve patching, configuration changes, or other mitigation strategies.

    - Incident Response Plan: Have an incident response plan in place for handling any security incidents that do occur.
